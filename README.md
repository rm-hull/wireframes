# Wireframes [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rm-hull/wireframes.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rm-hull/wireframes)

A lightweight 3D rendering engine in Clojure & ClojureScript.

![Aventador](https://raw.github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/master/doc/gallery/translucent/aventador.png)

Adapted and extended from a javascript demo (originally by Kragen Javier Sitaker, see references below)
into a Clojure/ClojureScript library (that renders to SVG, an HTML5 Canvas or a Graphics2D object -
depending on the runtime environment, obviously).

This started out as a experiment to plot Lorenz attractors in 3D space, but it turns out to be a really
*simple* way to programmatically generate three dimensional geometric shapes - basically a programmable
CAD system - I'm pretty sure that AutoCAD could already do this (and much quicker too), but where I
would really like to go with this is:

* build up a robust and idiomatic Clojure API for generating shapes
* implement a wide variety of output renderers - potentially even a GLSL cross-compiler and
  certainly a gcode output formatter suitable for 3D printers
* maintain 100% compatibility with ClojureScript

As this is a *software* renderer, please don't expect OpenGL levels of performance (or until WebGL
and OpenGL renderers have been written).

A variety of (in-progress) generated shapes and demos:
* A [gallery](https://github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/blob/master/GALLERY.md) of some shapes 
  and imports from common 3D formats, 
* An [animated torus tumbling in 3D space](http://programming-enchiladas.destructuring-bind.org/rm-hull/7098992), 
  and other shapes,
* A [taxonomy of 3D polyhedra](http://programming-enchiladas.destructuring-bind.org/rm-hull/9261323).

### Pre-requisites

You will need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.3.4 or above installed.

### Building

To build and install the library locally, run:

    $ lein test
    $ lein install

To re-generate the examples in the ```doc/gallery``` directory, run:

    $ lein test :examples

### Including in your project

There is an 'alpha-quality' version hosted at [Clojars](https://clojars.org/rm-hull/wireframes).
For leiningen include a dependency:

```clojure
[rm-hull/wireframes "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]
```

For maven-based projects, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>rm-hull</groupId>
  <artifactId>wireframes</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Basic Usage

See the [API Documentation](http://rm-hull.github.io/wireframes).

### Creating shapes

There are some drawing primitives in the ```wireframes.shapes``` namespace to create
objects such as lines, bezier curves, polygons, circles, cuboids, cylinders and torus shapes.

The basic mechanism for *building* shapes is **extrusion**. For example, to create a cube,
start with a square polygon in the X-Y plane, and extrude that shape into a line along the
Z-axis, as per the following code:

```clojure
(use 'wireframes.shapes.primitives)

(->
  (make-polygon
    (make-point 0 0 0)
    (make-point 0 1 0)
    (make-point 1 1 0)
    (make-point 1 0 0))
  (extrude (translate 0 0 1) 1))
```

### Drawing shapes

There are various software renderers in the ```wireframes.renderer``` namespace for
output to java images, SVG or HTML5 canvas (the availability of which combinations
depends on whether you are executing the code in Clojure or ClojureScript).

#### Clojure

For example, in Clojure, to generate a torus angled in the Y- and Z-axles, written
out to a PNG file:

```clojure
(use 'wireframes.shapes.curved-solids)
(use 'wireframes.transform)
(use 'wireframes.renderer.bitmap)
(use 'wireframes.renderer.color)

(write-png
  (->img
    #(draw-solid
      {:focal-length 3
       :color-fn (wireframe :white :transparent)
       :style :transparent
       :transform (combine
                    (rotate :z (degrees->radians 65))
                    (rotate :y (degrees->radians -30))
                    (translate 0 0 16))
       :shape (make-torus 1 3 60 60)} %)
    [400 400])
  "torus-65.png")
```

### Surfaces and other primitives

MATLAB-style function plots can be generated thus:

```clojure
(use 'wireframes.shapes.primitives)
(use 'wireframes.transform)
(use 'wireframes.renderer.bitmap)
(use 'wireframes.renderer.lighting)
(use 'wireframes.renderer.color)

(defn sqr [x]
  (* x x))

(defn sinc
  "Unnormalized/cardinal sine function"
  [x] (if (zero? x)
        1.0
        (/ (Math/sin x) x)))

(defn sombrero [x y]
  (* 15 (sinc (Math/sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y ))))))

(write-png
  (->img
    #(draw-solid
      {:focal-length 30
       :color-fn (comp
                   black-edge                         ; [1]
                   (positional-lighting-decorator     ; [2]
                     default-position
                     (spectral-z -6.5 15)))           ; [3]
       :style :shaded
       :transform (combine
                    (rotate :z (degrees->radians 15))
                    (rotate :x (degrees->radians 135))
                    (scale 0.05)
                    (translate 0 0 10))
       :shape (make-surface                           ; [4]
                (range -22 22 0.25)
                (range -22 22 0.25)
                sombrero)} %)                        ; [5]
    [600 600])
  "sinc3D.png")
```

#### Program Notes
TODO

### Loading common 3D shape files

The defacto/clichÃ©d Utah teapot (or any patch/vertex 3D file) can be loaded in with the following
code sample:

```clojure
(use 'wireframes.shapes.patch-loader)
(use 'wireframes.renderer.bitmap)
(use 'wireframes.transform)

(write-png
  (->img
    #(draw-solid
      {:focal-length 10
       :fill-color Color/WHITE
       :style :translucent
       :transform (combine
                    (rotate :z (degrees->radians 35))
                    (rotate :x (degrees->radians -70))
                    (translate 0 -1 40))
       :shape (load-shape "resources/newell-teapot/teapot")} %)
    [1000 900])
  "teapot.png")
```
which generates:

![Teapot](https://raw.github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/master/doc/gallery/translucent/teapot.png)

The following file formats support loading:

* Patch files in the ```wireframes.shapes.patch-loader``` namespace,
* Wavefront .obj files in the ```wireframes.shapes.wavefront-loader``` namespace,
* Stereolithography .stl files in the ```wireframes.shapes.stl-loader``` namespace

### Saving 3D shapes to STL-format files

Once generated or loaded by whatever means, a shape may be persisted in STL format with the following code sample:

```clojure
(use 'wireframes.shapes.stl-loader)
(use 'wireframes.shapes.curved-solids)

(save-shape
  (make-torus 1 3 60 60)
  "a description which will get truncated to 80 chars"
  "doc/gallery/torus.stl")
```

This specific [torus](https://github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/blob/master/doc/gallery/torus.stl), the
[teapot](https://github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/blob/master/doc/gallery/teapot.stl) and a
[wineglass](https://github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/blob/master/doc/gallery/wineglass.stl)
can then be viewed using the GitHub 3D viewer.

## Contributing

You're more than welcome to pitch in, there are loads of interesting computational
geometry features I'd like to implement (as well as a few bugs to squash) - take a
look at the TODO list and the references above.

If there's any you feel you'd specifically like to have a go at, create an
[issue](https://github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/issues/new) and I'll back-fill it
with some background information to get you going, and it can then be used as
the discussion focus.

Fork the repo, create a feature branch and once the feature is complete, submit
a pull request. Also, please try and add some tests where practical (demo's and
examples even more so) and keep this README up-to-date, and make sure you've pulled
from origin master before doing a PR.
